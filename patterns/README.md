# Algorithm Patterns

This directory organizes interview problems by reusable patterns rather than individual problem statements.

Each pattern folder typically contains:
- `notes.md` explaining when and why to use the pattern
- One or more clean, readable example solutions

Focus areas:
- Pattern recognition
- Tradeoffs between approaches
- Clear verbal explanation during interviews

This is a reference library, not a checklist.
