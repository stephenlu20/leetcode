# Interview Preparation Repository

This repository is used to prepare for mid to senior-level software engineering interviews through a combination of:

- Daily problem-solving practice (LeetCode / HackerRank)
- Pattern-based algorithm study
- Ongoing personal project development
- Lightweight system design notes

The focus is on clarity, tradeoffs, and real-world applicability rather than volume.
